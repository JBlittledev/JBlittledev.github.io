            <p>&emsp;&emsp; My journey is marked by a variety of interests and hobbies that keep me engaged and excited. I see myself as a young, curious, up-for-the-challenge person, with a proactive and responsible mindset, together with a deep interest in setting and achieving new goals for personal and professional growth.</p>
        
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Throughout different roles during my professional journey, I've developed both hard and soft skills and experience in different scopes such as management, leadership, effective organization, and planning for both short-term and long-term goals. On the human development front, teamwork, team management, recruitment processes, and coaching, collectively contributed as well to my well-rounded professional profile.
            </p>
        
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Currently, my primary focus is to kickstart a career as a junior developer. This represents a significant shift for me, but I've been actively improving my technical skills with essential tools to confidently take on this new challenge.</p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In the "off-duty side," sports have always been a big part of my life. I find joy in the freedom of cycling either on road or off road, the thrill and commitment of surfing and skateboarding, and the patience of fishing. Right now, I'm trying to arrange some time to get deeper into climbing, discovering new heights both figuratively and literally.</p>
        
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Beyond sports, I have a special taste for craftsmanship. Woodwork, old bike restoration, and bike mechanics are my refuge where I combine my love for cycling with a hands-on approach to maintenance and improvement.</p>
        
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Music is my constant companion, and I'll admit, I'm a bit picky about it. Whether it's the beat of a drum, the strum of a guitar, or the melody of a piano, each note resonates with me in a unique way.</p>
        
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Cinema is another world I love to immerse myself in. The power of storytelling on the big screen never fails to captivate me, and I'm always on the lookout for hidden gems and cinematic masterpieces.</p>
