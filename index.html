                <p> &emsp;&emsp;My name is Jo√£o Bernardo, recently certified by OutSystems, and fresh out of the OutSystems boot camp, I'm currently looking for my first role as a Junior Outsystems Developer.</p>

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;As this is a new path for me, my skills are mostly in low-code development but I've been working deeper into traditional web development such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This site serves as a living portfolio, showcasing my dedication to continuous learning and my desire to bridge the gap between low-code and traditional development.</p>
        
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm thrilled to share my journey and skills with you through this platform. You can navigate through this website and leave a word at the end, as your ideas and comments aren't just appreciated - they're invaluable to me.</p>
        
                <p>Happy coding!</p>
