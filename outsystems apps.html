            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Here I share my current OutSystems app portfolio, a collection of projects I've been working on. While there were more apps in development, I've carefully selected those currently eligible for display, with ongoing improvements.</p>

                    <h4>Pastry - My Library</h4>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Named humorously as Pastry, this app serves as my personal library. It encompasses everything I've learned, from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics. I plan to share it with the community to assist new developers in enhancing their skills and, if possible, collect feedback from senior developers to improve my code.</p>

                    <p class="ellipsis">&emsp;&emsp;This project's scope was to create an application so that our clients could book sports fields in differentlocations and at different times.
                        It was a project that I embraced from the start and in which I took on new tasks unrelated to development. Mymain concerns during the initiation week were, together with the project manager, to meet with the client and runa set of questions to better understand their needs.
                        To clarify the process, I worked on process diagrams and created personas. I also designed wireframes, theproject architecture, and the data model to ensure a solid foundation for what was to come.
